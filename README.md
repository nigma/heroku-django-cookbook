Django and Heroku Cookbook
==========================

Collection of snippets and scripts that solve certain problems when deploying
Django apps to Heroku.

Scripts in the `bin` directory are post-compile hooks that are invoked by
the `heroku-buildpack-python`'s
[compile](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python/blob/master/bin/compile)
step. You can install them by copying the `bin` directory into the root
directory of your Heroku application repository.

Installing NodeJS and Less compiler for static assets compilation in your Django app
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heroku provides a bunch of different
[buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) that target many
popular platforms like Python, Ruby, NodeJS and Java web apps and backends.
While this is great and allows you to deploy virtually anything with a simple
git command, the out-of-the-box solutions offer a limited set of utilities
that are available during the
[Slug compilation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler) phase.
In particular no NodeJS, NPM or [LESS Compiler](http://lesscss.org/)
is available in the `heroku-buildpack-python`. This means that there
is no straightforward way of compiling `.less` stylesheets during
the app deployment.

Fortunately, the Python buildpack provides hooks for running pre-compile
and post-compile scripts. This can be used for customizing the compilation
step and running additional commands without the necessity of maintaining
a separate fork of Heroku's buildpack.
The only thing you need to do is to create a proper `bin/post_compile` bash
script in the root directory of your application.

The [bin](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/bin) and
[.heroku](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/.heroku) directories
contain a set of scripts that can be used to install NodeJS/Less and invoke
`manage.py collectstatic` and `manage.py compress` commands in your Django application:

- [bin/post_compile](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/bin/post_compile)
- [bin/install_nodejs](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/bin/install_nodejs)
- [bin/install_less](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/bin/install_less)
- [bin/run_collectstatic](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/bin/run_collectstatic)
- [bin/run_compress](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/bin/run_compress)
- [.heroku/collectstatic_disabled](https://github.com/nigma/heroku-django-cookbook/tree/master/.heroku/collectstatic_disabled)

Just copy them over to your app repository and have your Less stylesheets
compiled with an assets compressor like
[Django Compressor](https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor).

Note: the empty ``/.heroku/collectstatic_disabled`` file deactivates the default collectstatic
build step that is part of the Heroku's buildpack. This will prevent the build script from doing
unnecessary work that is already handled by the above scripts.

A note on hosting static files on Amazon S3. Remember to enable the
[environment variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets#config-vars-during-build)
if you are using django-storages and uploading static assets to S3:

`heroku labs:enable user-env-compile`


Automatic Django configuration and utilities for Heroku
-------------------------------------------------------

[django-herokuify](https://github.com/nigma/django-herokuify) is a Django settings helper
that makes is very easy to configure database, cache, storage, email and other
common services for your Django project running on Heroku:

```python
import herokuify

from herokuify.common import *              # Common settings, SSL proxy header
from herokuify.aws import *                 # AWS access keys as configured in env
from herokuify.mail.mailgun import *        # Email settings for Mailgun add-on

DATABASES = herokuify.get_db_config()       # Database config
CACHES = herokuify.get_cache_config()       # Cache config for Memcache/MemCachier
```

See the [project page](https://github.com/nigma/django-herokuify) for more information.

All in one
----------

[Django Modern Template](https://github.com/nigma/django-modern-template) is a project
template for easy bootstrapping a Django project that can be deployed on Heroku.

Clean virtualenv
----------------

Heroku caches Python virtual environment and all installed packages between
project deploys.

Since the ``CLEAN_VIRTUALENV`` flag has been removed from the buildpack,
currently the only way to clean app cache is by
[changing the runtime](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-runtimes#changing-runtimes).
